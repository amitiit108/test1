  utter_lost_job:

  utter_fun:
  - text: Great, first lets try to find some new friends,like a treasure hunt...
  utter_appreciation:
  - text: OK,first clue question,how do you go to school? <Bus> <Bike> Walking>
  utter_school_vehicle:
  - text: Great,so let's start with a bus friend,ok? 
  utter_friend:
  - text: So,have you said hi, or smiled at him?
  utter_react:
  - text: There you have it,he's looking to make friends too.
  utter_reaction_nexttime:
  - text: Thats the spirit ! Jimmy, what do you like to do, sports, music ?
  utter_hobby:
  - text: Wonderful,how about you check with the coach in school if you can try out for the team here too?
  utter_coach_consultation:
  - text: Yes and you'd automatically be part of a group.
  utter_mood:
  - text: See it's not as bad as you thought infact, once you start feeling happy and get busy with friends and school, Mom and Dad will also feel better,things will settle down like before.
  utter_hope:
  - text: Of course you can,Jimmy,I'm right here for you. We'll think of more ways to make you feel better and you can tell me about your day.
  utter_troubling_me:
  - text: Ok, that's a tough situation,do you want to talk about this some more?
  utter_assumptio:
  - text: Of course, lets try and work together to help you. Is it ok if I ask you
      for some more information?
  utter_affirms:
  - text: Dave, how long have they been bothering you?
  utter_new_school:
  - text: Can you remember ,how it started,maybe you got into a fight or something?
  utter_lunch_line:
  - text: Dave,let me say,Im proud of you for coming out and talking about this tough
      situation.
  utter_thanks:
  - text: Can you tell how they trouble you <Verbal Taunts> <Physical harm> <Both>
  utter_pushed_playground:
  - text: Is it one boy or a group of them together?
  utter_kinda_follow:
  - text: Is this boy who starts it ,bigger, stronger and meaner?
  utter_picks_kids:
  - text: Do they usually do all this in recess and home time?
  utter_affm:
  - text: Also, are they more bold when they see you're alone?
  utter_irm:
  - text: Ok,so Dave ,you are dealing with something called Bullying
  utter_not_sure:
  - text: It is important that you understand that all this is not your fault.
  utter_bully_me:
  - text: Bullies don't always need a reason,they just feel very  smart and strong
      by picking on others. How do they trouble you? <by saying mean things> <physical
      hitting>
  utter_pushedme_playgroundhurt:
  - text: Dave, have you told your parents or your teacher about what you're going
      through?
  utter_deny:
  - text: I know,it is scary but it's also important that they know what's happening
  utter_find_boys:
  - text: I understand your fear,so mention it to your teacher and she'll make sure
      your name stays out of it, they're probably bullying other kids too.
  utter_tellteacher_parents:
  - text: Dave, you know maybe your mom or dad could drive you to school once or twice
      a week, do you think that would help in anyway?
  utter_outside_forparents:
  - text: Right, they might even figure out that you've told your parents, that'll
      scare them.
  utter_howcome:
  - text: Bullies are strong only untill they feel you're scared and will keep quiet
      and not tell any body.
  utter_kids_trouble:
  - text: Sure,that's a great idea,maybe it'll help them too. Now ,let's work out
      some simple steps to help you deal with this safely.
  utter_good_appriciation:
  - text: Dave, I'm sure you have a few friends in class?
  utter_group_5friends:
  - text: So ,is it possible to move around with your group or atleast keep one or
      two of them with you in recess and hometime?
  utter_scared:
  - text: Another thing you can try is ,if they make fun of you or say something mean,just
      look at them and walk away without any response---That often takes away their
      fun.
  utter_will_do:
  - text: That's the spirit Dave ! Even once you talk to the teacher, they will not
      stop immediately,that is why it is important that you stay in a group,not respond
      or react to them. Your safety is most important.
  utter_afis:
  - text: Dave, always remember you have not done anything wrong, so stay confident
      and positive about yourself.
  utter_keepit:
  - text: You know a lot of Bullies,are mean because they were bullied at some point.
  utter_oh:
  - text: Dave, tell me how do you go and come from school <BUS> <BIKE> <WALK>
  utter_vehicle_bike:
  - text: Ok,so you bike with your friends or alone?
  utter_alone:
  - text: Dave ,you must remember if you ever encounter your Bully when you are alone,
      immediately run to a safe place ,where there are  people or shout for help,DO
      NOT respond, react or challenge him.
  utter_gotit:
  - text: Dave,if you see someone else being bullied, how do you feel?
  utter_help_friends:
  - text: That is a positive thought,so stay safe and help others also. Let's work
      on the things we've talked about today and I hope you're feeling a little calmer
      ?
  utter_share_problem:
  - text: I am right here ,whenever you feel like talking again. Take and stay safe.
